# Operators

![Different operators supported by Python](.gitbook/assets/operators.png)

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, division, etc, and return the result which an arithmetic operator is calculated.

| Operator |                                                     Description | Example |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| + | Adds operands on either side of the operator | 3 + 2 = 5 |
| - | Subtracts right operand from the left operand | 5 - 2 = 3 |
| \* | Adds operands on either side of the operator | 2 \* 3 = 6 |
| / | Perform division operation. The result is a `Float` value | 12 / 5 = 2.4 |
| % | Performs modulo division. This will give us the Remainder | 7 / 4 = 3 |
| // | Performs Floor division. It returns the quotient if both the operands are positive.  If any of the operands is negative then it returns the floor value. i.e., rounded away from zero \(towards the infinity\) | 7//2 = 3 and 7.0//2.0 = 3.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0 |
| \*\* | Power | 2 \*\* 3 = 8 |

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used for comparing operands on either side of the operator. It returns `True` or `False` based on the condition.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| &gt; | Greater than - `True` if the left operand is greater than right operand | 5 &gt; 3 |
| &lt; | Less than - `True` if the left operand is less than the right operand | 2 &lt; 6 |
| &gt;= | Greater than or Equal to - `True` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand | 2 &gt;= 2 |
| &lt;= | Less than or Equal to - `True`  if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand |  3 &lt;= 3 |
| == | Equal to - `True` if  both operands are exactly equal  |  6 == 6 |
| != | Not Equal to - `True` if operands are not equal | 5 != 4 |

### Logical Operators

`and`, `or` and `not` are Logical Operators.
