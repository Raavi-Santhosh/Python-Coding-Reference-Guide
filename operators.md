# Operators

![Different operators supported by Python](.gitbook/assets/operators.png)

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| + | Adds operands on either side of the operator | 3 + 2 = 5 |
| - | Subtracts right operand from the left operand | 5 - 2 = 3 |
| \* | Adds operands on either side of the operator | 2 \* 3 = 6 |
| / | Perform division operation. The result is a `Float` value | 12 / 5 = 2.4 |
| % | Performs modulo division. This will give us the Remainder | 7 / 4 = 3 |
| // |  |  |
| \*\* | Power | 2 \*\* 3 = 8 |
